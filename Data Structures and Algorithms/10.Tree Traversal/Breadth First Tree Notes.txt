Let’s go over the steps taken to create a breadth-first search function:

Before starting the search, define the tree’s root node as well as a value to search for.
Initialize a frontier queue, which holds a path for each node to search
Loop through the frontier queue to check if the node value matches the value we are searching for.
Continue the search by adding child nodes to the frontier until the goal has been found, or the tree has been completely searched.
